## Problem Understanding
**What the problem is asking:** [Problem is a asking to make a scientific calculator which consists of some maths function which we have to see in the user's input and give output accordingly , some are basic maths functions and some require deep knowledge to make them by expansions]

**Key concepts involved:** [having input in form of string , making the complex functions with some expansions , checking which operation we need to do , basic arithmetic , error seeing like /0 case,etc]

**My approach:** [taking input as string as it is more flexible , i searched on how can i make the functions , learnt more about string properties and after making for one , i just use the concept repeatedly for other functions.]

##  Conceptual Learning

### **New Concepts I Discovered**
- **[Concept Name]:** [to find from user's input by input.find]
- **[Another Concept]:** [using ss.ignore to take the number only for evaluating like we dont need sqrt]

### **How I Applied These Concepts**
[For functions like sqrt, sin, cos, I used loops that keep improving the answer step-by-step.
I stopped the loop when the change between steps became small (less than 1e−10)(i searched this value tbh).]

### **Real-World Connections**
[scientific calculator is helpful in both academic and professional needs as it can handle hard mathematical calculations also]

Test Cases:
5 + 3         = 8
10 - 4        = 6
6 * 7         = 42
20 / 5        = 4
2 ^ 10        = 1024
sqrt(16)      = 4
sqrt(2)       = 1.4142
ln(2.7182818)  = 1
exp(1)         = 2.7183
log10(1000)   = 3
sin(1.57) = 1
cos(0)        = 1
tan(0.78) = 1
